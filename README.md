# Sounds

This is a small web application to manage music metadata, built as a test for a job application for Simfy.

You can see it in action in
http://sounds-cd.herokuapp.com/
or check all the code in this repo.

This application is built using Ruby on Rails 3.2 with Twitter Bootstrap as the base, and some other gems for various tasks: forms, validation, uploads, search... you can check the details in the Gemfile. It uses PostrgreSQL as the database engine to enable easy deploying to Heroku and fast, no-frills search.

Hope you like it!
