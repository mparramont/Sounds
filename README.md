# Sounds

Small web application to manage music metadata.

To build it, clone the repo and at the root execute:

```bash
bundle install
rake db:setup
```

To check the tests, run:
```bash
rake
```

You can see it in action in
http://sounds-cd.herokuapp.com/
or check all the code in this repo.

This application is built using Ruby on Rails 4.0 with Twitter Bootstrap as the base, and some other gems for various tasks: forms, validation, uploads, search... you can check the details in the Gemfile. It uses PostgreSQL as the database engine to enable easy deploying to Heroku and fast, no-frills search.

Hope you like it!
